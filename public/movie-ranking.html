<h1>The Best Shows According to Priyanshu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Shows of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1.One Piece (Anime)</h3>

<p>This is my favourite anime. This is pure greatness, a MUST watch for all Anime fans. Story is perfection Comedy is breathtaking Action is marvelous Drama is absolutely amazing Absolutely Thrilling Romance is great too The length of this Anime may scare you off, but trust me when you start watching and get past the 50th episode, you won't know when you've reached the latest episode and be like "I've caught upto all of it already!? Damn I want more!"</p>
<h3>2.Naruto (Anime)</h3>
<p>Absolutely love this show, because it gives out so much inspiration and the motivation plus you go through all of the emotions that are in this world you go through all of the emotions and thats masterpiece. Naruto is an out-and-out action mine filled with stylish martial arts fight sequences, with tones shifting occasionally between intense and lighthearted, depending on the backdrop and buildup. It still amazes me to date how one can come up with such a fantastic fight choreograply mad draw it with hand, and that too a number of times to deliver the right product!</p>
<h3>3.Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>Game of thrones is the best show to ever reach television, and coming from me, that's saying something-trust me. When i first started watching this show I knew I would have to pay close attention as the plot progressed, because I heard it was insanely confusing to keep track of everything: and so, I watched all 8 season 3x over, and now call myself a GOT expert. The plot is exquisite, and the scenery is breathtaking. If you like awe-inspiring shows, in this one, there are an enlless anot of "goosebump-giving" scenes where chills run down your back, so that department should be covered. What also makes watching this show so good, is the fact that everyone else has watched it, and now you can talk with them about it! If you wanna be an expert on this show, there at least 100 main characters, so I suggest watching it multiple tim</p>
